Since we have key pairs and address, now we can let user initialize a trancation and signing it, then others can verify the transaction. First we need to define the struct of transaction as following:

```rs
use serde::Serialize;
#[derive(Serialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Transaction {
    pub sender: String,
    pub recipient: String,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub signature: String,
}
```

A transaction will record the amount of money to transfer ,and record the sender and receiver. One of most important thing is to verify that, the transaction is really initalized by the given sender, therefore we need to include the
signature created by the sender, if we can verify the sginature from the sender by using his public key, then we can make sure the transaction is the real intention of the sender.

Let's add code to generate a transaction object as following:

```rs
 pub fn sign_transaction(&self, receiver: &String, amount: u64) -> Transaction {
        let mut transaction = Transaction {
            sender: self.address.clone(),
            recipient: receiver.clone(),
            amount,
            signature: String::new(),
        };
        let serialized_str = serde_json::to_string(&transaction).unwrap();
        let serialized = serialized_str.as_bytes();
        let sig: Signature = self.signing_key.sign(&serialized);
        transaction.signature = hex::encode(sig.to_bytes());
        transaction
    }
```

sign_transaction get the address of receiver and the amount for the trnasaction, then it first convert the transaction object into json string which is easy for signing. Then is sign the transaction json string by using the private key
of the wallet owner, then it convert the signature into binary data and save it as hex string in the field of signatre. Now we can verify the transaction as following:

```rs
pub fn verify_transaction(transaction: &Transaction) -> bool {
        let signature_str = transaction.signature.clone();
        let signature_bin = hex::decode(signature_str).unwrap();
        let mut transaction_clone = transaction.clone();
        transaction_clone.signature = String::new();

        let serialized_str = serde_json::to_string(&transaction_clone).unwrap();
        let serialized = serialized_str.as_bytes();
        
        //need to specify the length of signature slice
        let sig_array: [u8; 64] = signature_bin.try_into().unwrap();

        //into trait ask compiler to check whether the variable can convert to type request by
        //Signature::from_bytes
        let signature = match Signature::from_bytes(&sig_array.into()) {
            Ok(sig) => sig,
            Err(e) => {
                println!("error: {:?}", e);
                return false;
            }
        };
        let public_key_str = transaction_clone.public_key.clone();
        let mut public_key_bin = hex::decode(public_key_str).unwrap();
        /*
        sec1 format is 0x04 || x coordinate of publick key || y coordinate of public key
        */
        public_key_bin.insert(0, 0x04);
        let public_key = VerifyingKey::from_sec1_bytes(&public_key_bin).unwrap();
        public_key.verify(serialized, &signature).is_ok()
    }
```
In the above code, we get a reference of a transactin instance, since we need to change its content, therefore we need to clone a new one. Then we get the signature hex string, and convert it into binary data. One thing need to be noticed is
that, if we want to convert a chunk of binary data into Signature object, we need to make sure the length of the binary chunk is 64 otherwise the convertion will fail. That's why we first convert the hex string into binary data chunk, then
using signature_bin.try_into to convert the slice of type u8 into a fix 64 bytes length array.

The other thing we need to pay attention to is the Signature::from_bytes requires its input parameter to be &GenericArray<..., ...>, but our sig_array is type of [u8; 64], therefore we use into() trait to ask the compiler to check whether
there is a way to convert [u8;64] type into type of GenericArray<..., ...>, luckly there is a trait implemented by type [u8;64] to convert itself to GenericArray<..., ...>, therefore Signature::from_bytes(&sig_array.into()) can execute 
normally.

And finally, we get the public key of the wallet and verify the signature with the message which is the json string format of the Transaction object, we can call the above code in main.rs as following:
```rs
fn main() {
    let wallet = Wallet::new();
    println!("private key: {}", wallet.private_key_str());
    println!("publikc key: {}", wallet.public_key_str());
    println!("address: {}", wallet.get_address()); 

    let transaction = wallet.sign_transaction(&"0x1234567890".to_string(), 100);
    println!("transaction: {:?}", transaction); 
    println!("verified: {}", Wallet::verify_transaction(&transaction));
}
```
Running the code above we can get result like following:

```rs
...
transaction: Transaction { sender: "1JWx6r5EqMY7uycq4HJWPKbAW9njdAX2pk", recipient: "0x1234567890", amount: 100, signature: "2737a12ae9566f088669bc005326fa9442fab543b4af51b844f8d2ff165420b4874e9093dea025f8cae2d5c3c091ae740ce2fb4c81bb70d82c7e4642ecaf2cf3" }
verified: true
```

Now let's see how to add a transaction to the blockchain, first we go into blockchain module, in its mod.rs, we import the wallet module as following:

```rs
use crate::wallet::{Transaction as WalletTransaction, Wallet};
```

Since there is alread a Transaction struct in the module,
